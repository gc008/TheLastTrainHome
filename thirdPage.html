		<p>An officer comes up to you and says, "We have officers everywhere. We've been looking for the guy. He's not anywhere." You go and review the CCTV security footage to see if the mastermind burglar boarded any trains. After a thorough investigation, he either eluded your fellow officers and you on the security cameras, or he never came here to begin with.</p>

		<p>Alone in the security room, you resign yourself to a cigarette. 0 - 1 Mastermind. He's already on a hot streak. It's time to put out his flame with a little gasoline.</p>
