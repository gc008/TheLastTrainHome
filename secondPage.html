		<p>As you arrive at the apartment, an all-too-eager forensic investigator starts quacking some all-too-familiar details about the robbery. He says, "This doesn't look like the mastermind's MO. He didn't take any of the artifacts in the safe. He only took the money and the keys." He tries to hand you a clipboard, but you brush past him, ignoring his rookie assumption. You go straight for the liquor table sitting by the window and pour yourself two fingers-worth of whiskey. As you go to take a sip, you give a humble toast to your reflection in the window, and you thank the witness for his generosity. The schmuck got robbed twice in one day. You suspect the mastermind might be rubbing off on you...</p>

		<p>You hear the tech's footsteps approaching you from behind, muffled by the rain falling like bullets outside. This time, he lays the clipboard on the table in front of you. On it is a detailed list of the things that were stolen, which amounted to $50,000 in cash and a ring binding a few keys together: an apartment key, car key, key to the safe, etc. But one key stands out from the rest. Older, bigger than the others, a golden, worn-down, medieval-looking key description catches your eye. Before your finger even touches the clipboard, the tech starts squawking about the key. He says the key is worth a lot of money and that this was a part of the wintness's antique collection. He goes on to say that the key is for accessing old, decommissioned railway tunnels, specifically for entrances at Grand Central Station and Penn Station.</p>

		<p>You hand him the empty glass and you head out the door.</p>
