		<p>A beat cop and a train conductor approach you and guide you to the decommissioned railroad line. Another forensic team awaits you there. A crime scene technician approaches you and explains that the door was partially open and they found footprints, but oddly enough, the footprints disappear before showing which direction the burglar went in, left or right. The thief most likely took a handcar. The train conductor chimes in and says, "The tunnel to the right leads to Central Park, and the tunnel on the left goes to the harbor."</p>

		<p>Your detective instincts tell you that time is running short. There are no second chances regarding this decision, and if you make the wrong one, the thief will most likely escape.</p>
