		<p>It's a dark and stormy night at the downtown New York City police precinct. You are busy polishing your brand-new, wing-tipped loafers when your detective badge falls off your desk. As you go to pick it up, the grizzled, short-tempered police chief tells you, "We've got a witness in the interrogation room claiming to have been robbed by your long-time arch foe, the mastermind burglar." You tidy your badge and make your way down to the interrogation room. Your hard-boiled interview technique makes the witness sing like a canary. He spills the beans on how the whole robbery went down.</p>

		<p>He tells you that he is a successful procurer of historical artifacts for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and that while being held at gunpoint by the mastermind, he was forced to open up his own personal safe in his high-rise luxury apartment. He goes on to say that the thief took $50,000 in cash from the safe, but none of the artifacts, all while being on his cell phone. He said very few words, but the witness recalls him saying ,"It's time to take the train," after a brief chuckle and then leaving the apartment, money in hand.</p>

		<p>While singing, the witness divulges one last interesting piece of information. The burglar kept the safe keys. While leaving, the witness points out to you, as he finishes drying his tears, "If the burglar mastermind was taking the train, Penn Station is right across from my apartment. And because of weekend traffic, trains are delayed."</p>

		<p>As you grab your old trusty trenchcoat, you decide where to head to first.</p>
