		<p>Making your way down the tunnel, your flashlight spots a handcar, and adjacent to it is an open door with a staircase leading up. Next to the door reads a sign that says "Metropolitan Museum of Art - Maintenence Entrance." You climb the stairs, knowing you're close behind the suspect because you can hear the telltale sound of drilling.</p>

		<p>Reaching the top, you catch the mastermind burglar off guard. He never stood a chance.</p>

		<p>You hold him at gunpoint, and he raises his hands and confesses his deeds. In his confession, he reveals his master plan to attempt to steal a famous painting of a train out from under the nose of an ongoing auction at the Met. He explains that the money from the safe was used to buy the handcar from his contact who he spoke to over the phone, and he used the old key to enter the tunnel and staircase.</p>

		<p>You tell him, "The only thing you've got is a one-way ticket to the precinct."</p>
