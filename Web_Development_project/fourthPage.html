		<p>An officer greets you in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. He's got an expression on his face like someone stole all the sprinkles off his donut. You brace yourself for bad news. The officer tells you that they found the door to the forgotten railroad tunnel, but they couldn't get the door even half open. He informs you that the tunnel collapsed years ago.</p>

		<p>You can get anywhere from Grand Central, but you somehow ended up at the only dead end.</p>

		<p>Another <i>Grand</i> slam for the mastermind. Meanwhile you're watching, chewing gum and blowing bubbles from the dugout.</p>
