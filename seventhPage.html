		<p>Nearing the end of the tunnel, you start feeling water under your wing-tipped loafers. You realize that further down, the tunnel is completely submerged in water. There is no sign of a handcar or any evidence that the burglar escaped this way. Your detective instincts tell you that he's long gone, and he's duped you again. It's time to drown your sorrows in coffee and donuts.</p>
